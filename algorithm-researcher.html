<h2>Algorithm researcher to work on Huawei Cloud</h2>

<!--
I am searching for a future colleague to work with me and others on Huawei Cloud.
If somebody wants to spend 100% time on algorithms plus some math, this position is for you.
I am the author of the job posting below.
If you have any questions or would like to apply, please contact me directly at gudkov.andrei@huawei.com
-->

<p>Here in Huawei Moscow Research Center we work on optimization problems that arise in all projects of our company.
Our particular team is responsible for core <a href='https://www.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/product/ecs.html'>Huawei Cloud</a> algorithms,
such as optimal placement and migration of virtual machines over physical hosts,
batch job scheduling, network flow/congestion control, load forecasting and so on.
We have never-ending stream of NPC problems and use a variety of methods to deal with them: network/graph algorithms,
LP solvers, evolutionary algorithms, and, of course, a lot of heuristics.
We are researchers: we do <i>not</i> have bugtacker, scrum or devops.
MSU alumni with 10+ years of experience constitute the majority of our team.</p>

<p>Perfect candidate would be a veteran software engineer who feels overqualified
to be a part of modern coding pipeline and instead would like to shift to more demanding
disciplines, namely algorithms and applied math.</p>

<p>Minimal requirements are the following:
<ul><li>good knowledge of classical Cormen-style computer science</li>
<li>ability to solve math test (it is not very hard, but still of university level)</li>
<li>diploma of one of the top Russian universities (MSU, MIPT, HSE are definitely ok)</li>
<li>motivation to work as a researcher</li></ul></p>

<p>We also expect candidates to have <i>one</i> of the following:
<ul>
<li>proficiency in C++</li>
<li>experience with math. optimization methods</li>
<li>experience in building distributed systems</li>
<li>PhD diploma and/or publications</li></ul></p>

<p>If you are interested, please contact me directly at <a href='mailto:gudkov.andrei@huawei.com'>gudkov.andrei@huawei.com</a>.
First step of hiring process is informal talk over the phone with me and other team members.</p>
